      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
When working with Verifiable Credentials, Decentralized Identifier (DID) based
Authentication, and Authorization Capabilities, a client application often needs
to request credential-related objects from a wallet or agent. This document
presents a specification that describes the format of those requests.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2 id="format">Request Overview</h2>

      <p>
To make a request for one or more objects wrapped in a Verifiable Presentation,
a <a>client</a> constructs a JSON request describing one or more queries that
it wishes to perform from the receiver.
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A sample query">
{
  query: [{
    type: 'APopularQueryType',
    // query details ...
  }, {
    type: 'AnotherQueryType',
    // query details ...
  }],
  challenge,
  recipients: [
    // an optional key agreement key for encrypting the response if
    // this is supported
  ]
}
      </pre>

    </section>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2 id="format">Query Types</h2>

      <p>
The <a>query type</a> serves as the main extension point mechanism for
verifiable credential requests. This document defines several common query
types.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Query By Example</h3>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A Query By Example query">
{
  query: [{
    type: 'QueryByExample',
    credentialQuery: {
      // an optional reason for requesting this credential that
      // may be shown to a user by their wallet software
      reason: 'We need you to prove your eligibility to work.',
      example: {
        '@context': [
          'https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1',
          'https://w3id.org/citizenship/v1'
        ],
        type: 'PermanentResidentCard'
      }
    }
  }],
  // a 128-bit randomly generated value encoded as a string (use a UUID);
  // it will be digitally signed in the authentication proof
  // that will be attached to the VerifiablePresentation response
  challenge: '3182bdea-63d9-11ea-b6de-3b7c1404d57f',
  recipients: [
    // an optional key agreement key for encrypting the response if this
    // is supported
  ]
}
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>DID Authentication Request</h3>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A DIDAuth request">
{
    query: [{
      type: 'DIDAuth'
    }],
    // a 128-bit randomly generated value encoded as a string (use a UUID);
    // it will be digitally signed in the authentication proof
    // that will be attached to the VerifiablePresentation response
    challenge: '99612b24-63d9-11ea-b99f-4f66f3e4f81a',
    // the domain that must be digitally signed in the authentication
    // proof that will be attached to the VerifiablePresentation
    // response, identifying the recipient
    domain: 'issuer.example.com'
  }
}
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3></h3>

        <p>
This query type would be included in a request to ask for Authorization
Capabilities or "zcaps" in the Verifiable Presentation.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A zCap Request query">
{
  query: [{
    type: 'zCapLdQuery',
    capabilityQuery: [{
      referenceId: `a-memorable-name`,
      allowedAction: ['read', 'write'],
      invoker: 'did:key:1234',
      delegator: 'did:key:1234'
      invocationTarget: {
        type: 'urn:edv:documents'
      }
    }, {
      referenceId: `another-memorable-name`,
      allowedAction: 'sign',
      invoker: 'did:key:1234',
      delegator: 'did:key:1234',
      invocationTarget: {
        type: 'Ed25519VerificationKey2018',
        proofPurpose: 'assertionMethod'
      }
    }]
  }]
}
        </pre>

      <h2 id="format">Usage Scenarios</h2>

      <p>
This request query format is intended to be used in a variety of protocols and
usage scenarios.
